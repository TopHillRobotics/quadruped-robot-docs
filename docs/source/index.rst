The Open Source Quadruped-Robot @The TopHill Robotics
===========================================

This project is developed by Robot Motion and Vision Laboratory at East China Normal University.

This project provides an architecture and many key algorithms to control quadruped robots, including state estimation, gait generation, stance and swing leg controllers. Our codes is written in portable C++. Most of the types defined in the project begin with the qr prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to avoid name clashing with your program. 

This project supports many quadruped robots (Unitree-robotics, Deep-robotics and Anymal). The codes were tested under ROS1 and Gazebo 9/11.

   This project is under active development.
