The Open Source Quadruped-Robot @The TopHill Robotics
===========================================

This project is developed by Robot Motion and Vision Laboratory at East China Normal University
Contact: tophill.robotics@gmail.com


This project provides an architecture and some key algorithms to control quadruped robots for robotics researchers and developers. Our codes is written in portable C++. Most of the types defined in the project begin with the qr prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to avoid name clashing with your program. 

This project supports many quadruped robots (unitree, deep-robotics and anymal). The simulation codes were tested under ROS and Gazebo 9/11. 


.. note::

   This project is under active development.
