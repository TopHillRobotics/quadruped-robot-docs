This project provides an architecture and some key algorithms to control quadruped robots for robotics researchers and developers. Our codes is written in portable C++. Most of the types defined in the project begin with the qr prefix. Hopefully this is sufficient to avoid name clashing with your program. 

This project supports many quadruped robots (unitree, deep-robotics and Anymal). The codes has been tested under ROS and ``Gazebo 9/11``. 


.. note::

   This project is still under active development.
