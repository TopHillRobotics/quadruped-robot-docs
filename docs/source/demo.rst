demo_trot_velocity
==================

This demo shows the trotting gait of a quadruped robot on flat ground. The objective of velocity control is controlling the forward speed of the quadruped robot and the outputs are the location of the supporting legs and the trajectory of mass centre for the next gait cycle.

demo_trot_position
==================

This demo shows the trotting gait of a quadruped robot on flat ground. The objectives of the position control is solving the inverse kinematics and keeping the torso balanced and the outputs are joint angle (by the inverse kinematics method) or torque (by the computed torque method).

demo_trot_keyboard
==================

This demo shows the trotting gait of a quadruped robot on flat ground. Users use a keyboard to control the forward speed and rotation.

demo_trot_joystick
==================

This demo shows the trotting gait of a quadruped robot on flat ground. Users use a game joystick to control the forward speed and rotation.

external_force_motion
==================

This demo shows the motion under external force.
